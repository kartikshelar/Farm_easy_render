        <br/><br/> 1.NPK should be applied to the soil considering important factors such as placement, proportion and time of crop cycle.

It should be applied during sowing and through broadcasting. The dosage should be as per the crop and the soil (As per general recommendation for the State). It is advised not to use the N. P. K. (10:26:26) with standing crops, application of N. P. K. (10:26:26) through seed- cum fertiliser gives more beneficial.

        <br/><br/> About the fertilizer:
        
        <br/>This grade is high in potassium and phosphorus and low in nitrogen, which is good for main application since autumn. It is particularly valuable for crops that require large amounts of available phosphorus and potassium in the soil. It is highly efficient on soils with low potassium content, fine-textured soils with a leaching water condition.

        <br/><br/> 1.Urea should be applied to the soil considering important factors such as placement, proportion and time of crop cycle.

        <br/> 2. If urea is applied to the bare soil surface, significant quantities of ammonia may be lost as a result of volatility because of its rapid hydrolysis to ammonium carbonate.It should be applied at the time of sowing and in standing crops (top dressing). Half part of the recommended dose at the time of sowing and remaining half part after 30 days in 2-3 equal parts at gaps of 15 days. The rapid hydrolysis of urea in soils is also responsible for Ammonia injury to seedlings, if large quantities of this material are placed with or too close to the seed. Proper placement of Urea with respect to the seed can eliminate this problem.
        
        <br/>3. Urea should be applied as per the crop requirement and soil conditions (According to general recommendations of the State).

        <br/><br/>About the fertilizer: 
        
        <br/> Urea is a source of Nitrogen, an essential nutrient crucial for crop growth and development.
